### Business Problem
For the bike sharing business, predicting the number of bikes precisely is very important to make right decisions. In this project, I am going to predict the number of borrowed bikes in a given day and station by using 4 available data set below.

- station.csv - Contains data that represents a station where users can pick up or return bikes.
- status.csv - Data about the number of bikes and docks available for a given station and minute.
- trips.csv - Data about individual bike trips.
- weather.csv - Data about the weather on a specific day for specific station id.
- Answers of the question 3 and 4 are at end of the notebook.
